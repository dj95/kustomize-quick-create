  A quick create wizard to create and modify opinionated kustomize deployments.
  <br><br>
  This tool should help to quickly create and build up kustomize deployments. It features a wizard, which
  will let you create the boilerplate configuration and underlying file structure. With a templateing
  engine the most important values are already set into the resources, such that only minor further tweaks
  should be required for getting the deployment up and running.

### üì¶ Requirements

- rust


### üöÄ Getting started

Clone the repository and run `cargo install --path .`. Then you should be able to call the wizard with `kustomize-quick-create`.
It will detect the kustomize deployment if it exists in the `kubernetes/` subdirectory of the present working dir.
