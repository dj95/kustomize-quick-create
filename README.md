  This tool should help to quickly create and build up kustomize deployments. It features a wizard, which
  will let you create the boilerplate configuration and underlying file structure. With a templateing
  engine the most important values are already set into the resources, such that only minor further tweaks
  should be required for getting the deployment up and running.
</p>


### üì¶ Requirements

- rust

*or*

- nix
- direnv


### üöÄ Getting started

Clone the repository and make sure the dependencies are installed. You either need rust installed or nix installed.
With nix use either `nix-shell` or `direnv allow` up to your preferences.
After dependencies are available run `cargo install --path .` to build install the tool. 

Then you should be able to call the wizard with `kustomize-quick-create`.
It will detect the kustomize deployment if it exists in the `kubernetes/` subdirectory of the present working dir.


### üß™ Customizing the templates

Templates are stored in the *templates/* directory of this repository and statically compiled into the binary.
Feel free to tinker around with the templates and customize them to your needs.
Please keep in mind that you need to update the fields of the relating struct in *src/resources* if you change them.
Simply search for the template name in the code base and you should be able to find them.


### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Installation with nix


Add the following code to your overlays. Then kustomize-quick-create can be installed from `pkgs`.

```nix
final: prev: {
  kustomize-quick-create = prev.pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
    version = "0.1.0";
    pname = "kustomize-quick-create";

    src = prev.fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "dj95";
      repo = pname;
      rev = "320d208c2660135ab2440a7d58db8859a35e29f7";
      sha256 = "sha256-rvkbVPd5pWat/oZDoHOH4Pr3uqpkWY0ixTZGG0Kgvuk=";
    };

    cargoSha256 = "sha256-Ay96cF3H3l7/yzU5ejOrK96T9WoEaIujiEM285qxMFU=";
  };
}
```
